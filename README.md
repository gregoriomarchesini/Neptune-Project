# Neptune-Project :milky_way:

 ## Project Description 
----------------------


The repo contains script which I used to analyse the Lyman-Alpha radiation emitted from the planet Neptune. The main scope of the project was indeed to analyse the flux density 
in the Lyman-Alpha band (1216 Ã…) which is extracted from a dataset of images withdrawed from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://archive.stsci.edu/) (HST) archive. Atomic Hydrogen is the principal source of Ly radiation through resonant scattering and it also happens to be the most abundant atomic species in our Universe. This implies that it is rather complicated 
to distinguish between the radiation derived directly from the atmosphere of the planet and other sources (Interplanetary Medioum, Sunlight reflected from the Planet and so on). A complete introduction on Lyman-Alpha radiation can be obtained from the
[Wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman-alpha_line) page on the topic.

Here I mention all the resources I used to obtain my datas and the artcles which I read in order to develop the project:

## Co-Developers
-------------------
I would like to thank professor Lorenz Roth for the time he is investing on the project. He first had the idea of the project and he is now following me through out the whole development.
